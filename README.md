#   Fraud Detection

##   Overview

    This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions. It involves building a system that can classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate by analyzing transaction data.

##   Dataset

    *(Provide details about the dataset used in the notebook. Where did it come from? What kind of transactions does it represent?)*

    **Description of Columns:**

    *(List the columns in the dataset and briefly explain what they represent. Infer from the notebook if a separate description isn't available)*

    * Example: `transaction_id`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
    * Example: `amount`: Transaction amount.
    * Example: `transaction_date`: Date of the transaction.
    * ...

  **First 5 rows of the dataset:**

  *(It's best to include an actual snippet if possible. If the notebook shows this, copy it here. If not, describe the general format)*

    ```
    #   Example (replace with actual data if available)
        transaction_id  amount  ...  is_fraud
    0   12345             100.00  ...  0
    1   67890             25.50   ...  0
    2   13579             1000.00 ...  1
    3   24680             50.00   ...  0
    4   98765             120.00  ...  0
    ```

  ##   Files

  * `fraud_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.

    ##   Code and Analysis

    *(Based on `fraud_detection.ipynb`)*

    **Libraries Used:**

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

    #   Add other libraries used in your notebook
    ```

    **Data Preprocessing:**

    Based on the `fraud_detection.ipynb` notebook, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

    * **Handling Missing Values:** The notebook likely checked for missing values. If present, imputation or removal techniques were used.
    * **Encoding Categorical Features:** If the dataset contains categorical features, they were encoded into numerical representations using methods like Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.
    * **Feature Scaling:** Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
    * **Data Transformation:** *(Mention if any specific transformations were applied, e.g., log transformation)*

    **Models Used:**

    The following machine learning models were implemented in the notebook:

    * Logistic Regression
    * Decision Tree
    * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    * Random Forest
    * Support Vector Machine (SVM)

    **Model Evaluation:**

    The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

    * Accuracy Score
    * Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
    * Confusion Matrix

    ##   Data Preprocessing üõ†Ô∏è

    * The data was preprocessed by handling missing values (if any),
    * encoding categorical features (if any),
    * and scaling numerical features.

    ##   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç

    The EDA process included:

    * Analyzing the distribution of features.
    * Visualizing relationships between features.
    * Examining the distribution of the target variable to understand class balance (i.e., the proportion of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions).
    * Using correlation matrices to understand feature relationships.

    ##   Model Selection and Training üß†

    * Several classification models were explored.
    * The data was split into training and testing sets.
    * Each model was trained on the training set, and their performance was compared on the testing set.

    ##   Model Evaluation ‚úÖ

    * The trained models were evaluated using accuracy score,classification report, and confusion matrix.
    * These metrics provided insights into the models' ability to correctly classify transactions.

    ##   Results ‚ú®

    * The project aimed to accurately detect fraudulent transactions.
    *  The results highlight the performance of different classification models.
    *   Key findings likely include the accuracy of each model, as well as precision, recall, and F1-score, especially for the fraud class (which is often the focus in fraud detection).

    ##   Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

    1.  Clone the repository.
    2.  Install the necessary libraries:

        ```bash
        pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
        ```

    3.  Run the Jupyter Notebook `fraud_detection.ipynb`.

    ##   Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

    The `fraud_detection.ipynb` notebook can be used to:

    * Load and explore the dataset.
    * Preprocess the data.
    * Train and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection.
